# Subanalyses of structural benchmark results

This folder contains scripts to perform subanalyses on the structural benchmark. These analyses cover:
- Identity vs DockQ analyses (scripts: `get_mmseqs2_evalue.py`, `get_training_pdb_seqres.py`, results: `mmseqs2_results/`) were conducted to see whether structural accuracy of the predictions was driven by existence of highly similar training structures. The resulting identity vs DockQ figures are saved under `./plots/`
- AFM-LIS rescoring (scripts: `run_calculate_lis.sh`, `calculate_lis.py`)
- LIS vs DockQ (scripts: `dockq_vs_lis.py`, `DockQ_vs_LIS_small.py`, results: `AFM-LIS_results/`, plots: `../plots/DockQ_vs_LIS.svg`, `../plots/DockQ_vs_LIS_small.{png,svg}`): the rescoring metric of protein-protein interactions (LIS) that was proven to be the most accurate in the classifier benchmark was correlated against DockQ to see whether the rescoring metric also correlates with structural accuracy 
- Receptor RMSD (script: `calculate_receptor_rmsd.py`, results: `../receptor_rmsds.csv`) was used to analyse the receptor RMSD of the predicted structures to see how different models perform on modelling the GPCR backbone
- pKi and peptide length vs DockQ score (script: `activity_vs_dockq.py`): Subanalysis to see whether structural accuracy is affected by binding affinity or peptide length. The results are stored in `activity_data.csv`, `activity_vs_dockq.csv`, and `peptide_length_vs_dockq.csv` and visualised in `./plots/DockQ_vs_pKi.svg` and `DockQ_vs_PeptideLength.svg`.
- Runtime analyses (script: `runtime_analyis.py`) compare the runtimes of each modelling tool against each other using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and save the results in `../wilcoxon_results_Runtime.csv`. The results are visualized in `../plots/runtime_comparisons.svg`.
- Random seed analyses (script: `seed_analyses.py`) analyse the results from additional models generated for AF2, AF3, and Chai-1 using five unique random seeds. The results from these analyses are stored in `seed_analyses_sds.csv` (average standard deviation in DockQ scores across five seed per model) and `seed_analyses_summary.csv` (show average DockQ score, standard deviation, min and max DockQ for each structure across five random seeds). The script outputs the results from Friedman's test that checks whether random seed has a significant effect on DockQ score in AF2, AF3, and Chai-1 predictions.
