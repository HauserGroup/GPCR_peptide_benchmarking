Running AlphaFold 3. Please note that standard AlphaFold 3 model parameters are
only available under terms of use provided at
https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md.
If you do not agree to these terms and are using AlphaFold 3 derived model
parameters, cancel execution of AlphaFold 3 inference with CTRL-C, and do not
use the model parameters.
